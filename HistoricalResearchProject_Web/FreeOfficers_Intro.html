	 <img src="NasserProfile.jpg" width="150px" Height="150px" Style="float:right;" /><img src="NaguibProfile.jpg" width="150px" Height="150px" Style="float:right;" /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revolution began on 1952, led by a group of  people who worked as a team called &ldquo;The Free Officers&rdquo;. There were two main  leaders of this revolution, they are colonel Gamal&nbsp;Abdel Nasser and  general Mohammed Neguib.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>1</sup></a> <br />
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The purpose of this revolution was to subvert King  Farouk, and end the monarchy in Egypt. <br />
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason that the Free Officers took a  stand is because King Farouk was guilty for not protecting the country from  the British troops in 1948. Therefore, he is not qualified for the ruler, and should be overthrown.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>4</sup></a> <br />
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Free Officers gathered supporters and eventually organized a military coup that  destroyed the palace, political  parties, and the police which hadled to the monarchy in Egypt.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>37</sup></a> <br />
	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gamal Abdel Nasser, the leader of the Free Officers, became the prime minister of Egypt,  and was elected as president in 1956.</p>
