	<p style="border: solid 10px transparent"> Gandhi first experienced discrimination towards Indians when he worked for the South African firm. He experienced the rising anti-Indian movements in local areas in which the government banned Indians from certain rights.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>9</sup></a>
	  <br />
	  After he came back to India, he saw what most of the Indians were experiencing and how the British rulers set up. In his speech, To Every Englishmen in India, he stated these harmful side-effects of the British rule, which included exploitations of resources, too much tax for the corrupted government, and suppressing revolts with un-just ways. <a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>25</sup></a>(See parts of the speech at the end)
	  <br />
	  Gandhi’s plan of solving the problem is through the pacifist way. He combined the traditional ideas of Indian culture and Hinduism with the “western” way of thinking. He summarized his ideas into 4 categories: Ahimsa(non-violence), Satya(to hold the truth firmly), Tapasya (willing to bare the sufferings in the conflict), and Swaraj (willing to fight for freedom and individual rights).<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>9</sup></a><br />

<blockquote>“But though my faith in your good intentions is gone, I recognize your bravery and I know that what you will not yield to justice and reason, you will gladly yield to bravery.
<br />
See what this Empire means to India:
<br />
Exploitations of India’s resources for the benefit of Great Britain. 
<br />
An ever-increasing military expenditure and a civil service the most expensive in the world. 
<br />
Extravagant working of every department in utter disregard of India’s poverty. 
<br />
Disarmament and consequent emasculation of a whole nation, lest an armed nation might imperil the lives of a handful of you in our midst. 
<br />
Traffic in intoxicating liquors and drugs for the purpose of sustaining a top heavy administration. 
<br />
Progressively representative legislation in order to suppress an ever-growing agitation, seeking to give expression to a nation’s agony. 
<br />
Degrading treatment of Indians residing in your dominions, and, <br />
You have shown total disregard of our feelings by glorifying the Punjab administration and flouting the Mussulman sentiment.”
