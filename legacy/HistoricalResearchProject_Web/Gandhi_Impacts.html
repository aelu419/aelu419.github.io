	 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gandhi&rsquo;s movements contributed to the final independence of India in August,  1947, where the British government decided to give India independence because  of the constant protesting and pressure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He also inspired  several civil rights movements in the US. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People in the US, especially those involved in the African American rights  movements, was inspired by the unique method adopted by Gandhi. This was shown  by the focus of the press, which represents what people at that time favored.  Also, Americans visited Gandhi and his supporters in India.
