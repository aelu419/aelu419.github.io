&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon after the establishment of the Soviet Union, Lenin signed a peace treaty with countries and stopped the war. He also made a lot of changes in politics and gave more rights to the people, especially the workers and peasants of Russia. He also promoted industrial growth and economic development, giving the people of Russia more job opportunities and creating a stable economy.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>41</sup></a>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The successful revolution made many people realize that they could revolt too if they are unified. This caused a tide of revolutions to happen all over the world, especially for the Communists. With the support of the Russians, Revolutions in Vietnam, Korea, China, and Cuba all succeeded and communists came to power. This also led to the fall of imperialism, since people craved freedom and rights and despised to just have one man control everyone's fate.<a target="_blank"href="bibliography.html"><sup>36</sup></a>
